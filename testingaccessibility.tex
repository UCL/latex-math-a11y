This document is intended for readers who \emph{already} use \LaTeX. A
number of very good guides already exist for learning \LaTeX.

\hypertarget{introduction-what-is-and-isnt-accessible}{%
\section{Introduction: what is and isn't
accessible}\label{introduction-what-is-and-isnt-accessible}}

What makes a document accessible is not a matter of what software
technology is used to produce it. An accessible document however
produced should meet the standards set out in
\href{https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/websites-apps/creating-accessible-content/accessibility-fundamentals}{UCL's
basic guidance on accessibility pages}.

The basics as set out there cover

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  structure;
\item
  formatting;
\item
  links;
\item
  labeling images;
\item
  use of colour;
\item
  content;%
\item
  transcripts and captions.
\end{itemize}

Issues regarding video material (\textbf{transcripts and captions}) are
not of particular relevance to \LaTeX~ users but I will address the
other matters below.

\hypertarget{guidance-for-latex-users}{%
\section{Guidance for LaTeX users}\label{guidance-for-latex-users}}

For screen-reader users, the least good solution is to provide the source
\LaTeX~ file. This is not generally acceptable. The burden of
understanding content from the raw \LaTeX~ is unacceptably high.

Instead, the source should be prepared in such a way as to produce a
document that is acceptably read by a screen reader. In some respects
the ideal would be a tagged PDF - since PDF is the usual output
generated in educational contexts. However, there is currently (to my
knowledge) no way to generate a fully tagged PDF document that includes
readable mathematics from \LaTeX~ source. The most accessible format
that can be readily generated from the \LaTeX~ source is HTML.  To create this HTML, 
writers can use the utility \textbf{pandoc} (``Pandoc - About
Pandoc'' n.d.) which ensures that the mathematical content is
transformed to MathML to be read by screen reader software. 

Mathematics is typeset in the usual way. For example:

\[\frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}{N}\]

I will describe using \textbf{pandoc} later in this document after I
have outlined steps to be taken in preparing the \LaTeX~ source.

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\subsection{Structure}\label{structure}}

Most LaTeX writers will use the \textbf{\textbackslash{}section\{\}}
family of commands to create a structured document. These heading styles
will be understood when a PDF is rendered and will create a navigable
document for a screen reader user. It is also recommended that a table
of contents is included to increase accessibility.

\hypertarget{formatting}{%
\subsection{Formatting}\label{formatting}}

\hypertarget{linespacing}{%
\subsubsection{Line Spacing}\label{linespacing}}

Set line spacing for your documents to one and a half lines using the package \emph{setspace}.  This makes available the command
\emph{\textbackslash onehalfspace}.  All text following this will be set with 1.5 line spacing (unless another
of the line spacing commands is issued to switch to another setting).

\hypertarget{fonts-and-typefaces}{%
\subsubsection{Fonts and typefaces}\label{fonts-and-typefaces}}

Where possible, change the font family for the document with the
following command in the preamble:

\begin{verbatim}
  \renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}
\end{verbatim}

This will set a sans serif \textbf{Computer Modern} as the default for
the document. Use \texttt{\textbackslash{}textbf\{\}} for emphasis
rather than \texttt{\textbackslash{}emph\{\}} which produces italic text
by default. If you are confident, you may consider redefining
\texttt{\textbackslash{}emph\{\}} to produce \textbf{bold text}. This is
not difficult but to preserve the toggling behaviour of
\texttt{\textbackslash{}emph\{\}} requires some LaTeX know how. The code
below isnerted in the document preamble will do it:

\begin{verbatim}
\makeatletter
\DeclareRobustCommand{\em}{%
  \@nomath\em \if b\expandafter\@car\f@series\@nil
  \normalfont \else \bfseries \fi}
\makeatother
\end{verbatim}

(\emph{Formatting - What Is the Canonical Way to Redefine the
\textbackslash{}Textbackslashemph Command} n.d.)

\hypertarget{links}{%
\subsubsection{Links}\label{links}}

\hypertarget{hyperlinks-to-web-pages}{%
\paragraph{Hyperlinks to web pages}\label{hyperlinks-to-web-pages}}

Use the command \texttt{\textbackslash{}href\{url\}\{linktext\}} rather
than use bare urls for inserting hyperlinks. So

\begin{verbatim}
\href{http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd}{ISD home page.}
\end{verbatim}

Which produces \href{http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd}{ISD home page.}

\hypertarget{internal-links-and-cross-references}{%
\paragraph{Internal links and cross
references}\label{internal-links-and-cross-references}}

It will be additionally helpful to make all \textbf{cross references} in
your document into internal hyperlinks. You can do this simply by import
the package \textbf{hyperref} in the preamble of your document with the
\texttt{\textbackslash{}usepackage} command. Usually, \textbf{hyperref}
must be the \textbf{last} package imported. The \textbf{table of
contents}, \textbf{cross references} to graphics and tables, and
citations, will all become document internal links. You can control the
colours used for links as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\hypersetup{
    colorlinks=true,
    linkcolor=blue,
    filecolor=magenta,
    urlcolor=cyan,
}
\end{verbatim}

You can use the general \LaTeX~ \texttt{\textbackslash{}tableofcontents}
command to generate a table of contents which will now be clickable and
will be usable for navigation by screen reader users.

\hypertarget{labelling-images-alt-text}{%
\subsection{Labelling images (Alt
text)}\label{labelling-images-alt-text}}

If all images (and tables, and graphs and charts) have captions, a
document created from your \LaTeX~ document will be reasonably
accessible. You might consider the placing of your captions: would it be
better for the caption to \textbf{precede} the graphical element rather
than follow it?

To create something more like true \textbf{alt-text}, you can use the
package \textbf{pdfcomment}. With this package you can create a tool-tip
for an element as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
\pdftooltip{\includegraphics{img.png}}{This is the ALT text}
\end{verbatim}

Here is an example:

\pdftooltip{\includegraphics{chick.jpg}}{This is a chick.}

Note that you cannot use this method with the \textbf{figure} environment, and so
images cannot have both a \emph{pdftooltip} and a \emph{caption}.

This works reliably with Adobe Reader, but some pdf readers may produce
a less good result.  You cannot use this method when producing HTML with \emph{pandoc}.
Instead you should use the \textbf{figure} environment as in figure \ref{chick}.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{chick.jpg}
\caption{This is a chick.}
\label{chick}
\end{figure}

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{chick.jpg}
\caption{This is a chick.}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{use-of-colour}{%
\section{Use of colour}\label{use-of-colour}}

General guidelines about the use of colour in images apply and should
guide the creation of images in \LaTeX~.

For some users a background colour other than white is helpful.  You can set the page background colour using the package
\emph{xcolor}.  This package makes a variety of colour control commands and of colours available.  Some colours are in the `base' \emph{xcolor} package, others are made available by \emph{options} when the package is loaded.  Here is an example of loading the package with the \emph{svgnames} options:

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[svgnames]{xcolor}
\end{verbatim}

This command

\begin{verbatim}
\pagecolor{Ivory}
\end{verbatim}

in the preamble will set the page background colour to \emph{Ivory} form the colours made available by the \emph{svgnames} option.

\hypertarget{using-pandoc}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Using
\textbf{pandoc}}{Using pandoc}}\label{using-pandoc}}

If you follow the advice above then a PDF document generated in the
usual way will be reasonably accessible with one important exception:
mathematical content. Unfortunately screen reader software will not cope
well with the mathematical content produced by the usual methods (ie
running latex or pdflatex commands.)

The best solution I have found is a two step procedure. Generate a
\textbf{tex} source file and use \textbf{pandoc} to convert it to html.
\textbf{Pandoc} allows an option to convert \LaTeX~ maths code to be
converted to MathML which is read very well by modern screen reader
software. This means that a document may need to be distributed in two
file formats, but the burden is relatively low since both are generated
from the same source.

You can download \textbf{pandoc} from
\href{https://pandoc.org/installing.html}{the pandoc installation page}.
It is available for Windows, MacOS, linux and Chrome OS.

\hypertarget{creating-the-web-page}{%
\subsection{Creating the web page}\label{creating-the-web-page}}

Once you have a tex source file you can generate the html equivalent by
typing the following code on the command line interface (terminal, cmd):

pandoc maths.tex --toc -s --mathml -o maths.html

assuming that your source file is called \textbf{maths.tex}.

\subsection{Shortcomings of Pandoc conversion}

Note that some things won't survive the conversion to HTML.  If you use
\emph{pdftooltip} to create alt-text for images, neither the image nor the tool-tip will appear in the 
HTML page.  For this reason, if you are going to create an HTML version of a document for accessibility, you 
should use the package \emph{graphicx} (as most \LaTeX~ users usually do) and provid captions.  Overall, 
I recommend the use of captions over tool-tip style alt-tex for this reason.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Giving up \LaTeX~ would be burdensome for many writers. Nothing else I
have so far provides for such simple and sophisticated typesetting not
only of general mathematics, but in my experience of logic and of the
notations used in linguistics. I suspect that the same is true of
typesetting other STEM subjects such as chemistry and the engineering
disciplines in general.

I am still testing documents produced according to the principles in
this document. So far the results are good but it is always possible
that I am missing some points or that people can offer improvements. I
welcome any comments by email to
\href{my\%20ucl\%20email\%20address}{j.tyson@ucl.ac.uk}.
